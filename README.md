# Flight-Price-Prediction
This repository contains a Flight Price Prediction model that uses machine learning techniques to estimate airfare based on various factors such as airline, departure time, duration, number of stops, and more. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using regression algorithms.

Features:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key factors affecting flight prices
Feature selection & engineering for better model performance
Regression models for price prediction
Hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy
Model evaluation
Interactive visualization of price trends

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost

ðŸ”— Dataset: Scraped or publicly available flight price datasets

Contributions and improvements are welcome! ðŸš€
